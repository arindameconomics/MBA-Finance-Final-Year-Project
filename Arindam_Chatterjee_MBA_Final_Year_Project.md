Title: An Empirical Evidence Of The International Fisher Effect Between
India and USA, China Using Regression Analysis

Author: Arindam Chatterjee

Abstract This paper is an attempt to examine the empirical evidence of
International Fisher Effect (IFE) between India and its two other major
trading partners, China and USA. Interest Rate Differentials are used in
IFE to explain why exchange rates change over time. Here Regression
Analysis approach is considered to trace the relationship between
nominal interest rates and exchange rates in these countries. The
estimated value of R Squared, obtained by applying the Regression
Analysis in the Minitab Statistical Software © from the data points
collected and/ or calculated using the Microsoft Excel ©, is used to
determine the relationship between interest rates and exchange rates for
yearly data from 1981 to 2019 and separately from 2001 to 2019, to check
whether the exchange rates can be explained more by applying the
International Fisher Effect as the world has now become a global village
due to Globalization and the concept Free Market with lesser
intervention of the Central Banks on the exchange rates. The empirical
results suggest that the International Fisher Effect (IFE) can be
explained more by using the data points in the years 2001 to 2019 than
1981 to 2019..
